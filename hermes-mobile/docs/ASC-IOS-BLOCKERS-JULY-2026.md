# App Store Connect — iOS blockers (Hermes Mobile 1.0)

**Updated:** 2026-07-09 21:25 ET (review notes redacted via API; demo-only template enforced)

## Review notes (fixed)

App Review Information notes were patched via `node scripts/patch-asc-review-notes.js` — demo path `hermes://setup?demo=1` only; **no** operator gateway URLs or API keys. See [ASC-REVIEW-DEMO.md](./ASC-REVIEW-DEMO.md).

## Current ASC state (API)

| Item | Value |
|------|--------|
| App | Hermes Mobile — AI Control (`com.iganapolsky.hermesmobile`, app id `6786778037`) |
| Version **1.0** | `WAITING_FOR_REVIEW` |
| Review submission | `9013e09a-3aa9-481b-b4ce-fc97bca82745` — `WAITING_FOR_REVIEW` (includes **app version only**, not subscription) |
| Listing metadata | en-US description ~1319 chars; iPhone 6.5/6.7 + iPad + 1 app preview present |
| Privacy policy URL | **`https://thumbgate.ai/privacy`** on `appInfoLocalizations` en-US (`e5cb7b2a-f43c-40f5-ace4-e6248c8fd1f7`) — set/confirmed via ASC API PATCH |
| Subscription group | Leash Pro (`22213637`), en-US localization present |
| IAP `thumbgate_leash_monthly` | Subscription id `6788168309`, **state `READY_TO_SUBMIT`** (was `MISSING_METADATA`) |
| IAP API-filled fields | en-US name/description, **175 territory prices** (USA $19.99 + equalizations), review screenshot `COMPLETE`, `availableInNewTerritories: true` |
| IAP localization state | `PREPARE_FOR_SUBMISSION` (not yet attached to version 1.0 review) |
| IAP root cause (fixed) | `availableInNewTerritories: true` required pricing for all territories; only USA was priced → `MISSING_METADATA` |
| Public App Store | `itunes lookup` → **0 results** (not searchable / not live) |

**Note:** `verify-asc-listing.js` reads `privacyPolicyUrl` from `appInfos`, which does not expose that field. The live URL is on **`appInfoLocalizations`**. A null there is a script gap, not a missing store field.

## What automation already did (this session)

1. `node scripts/verify-asc-listing.js` — gaps: `MISSING_METADATA`, false-null privacy on `appInfos`.
2. `node scripts/ensure-asc-leash-subscription.js` — group/loc/price/screenshot already present; subscription still `MISSING_METADATA`.
3. PATCH `appInfoLocalizations` en-US → `privacyPolicyUrl: https://thumbgate.ai/privacy` (idempotent).

## Security (2026-07-09)

App Review notes must **never** contain operator gateway URLs, Tailscale hostnames, or API keys. Use `hermes://setup?demo=1` only. Guard: `node scripts/verify-asc-listing.js` (fails on `ts.net` / `sk-hermes-api` in notes). Emergency redact: `node scripts/asc-chrome-redact-review-notes.js`.

## Blockers to **public** listing

1. **Apple review queue** — binary + metadata submitted; app not approved/released yet (`WAITING_FOR_REVIEW`).
2. **IAP not in review with version** — `thumbgate_leash_monthly` is `READY_TO_SUBMIT` but **not attached** to version 1.0 submission. API error: `FIRST_SUBSCRIPTION_MUST_BE_SUBMITTED_ON_VERSION`. Active review submission (`9013e09a…`) is **app-only** and rejects new items while `WAITING_FOR_REVIEW`.
3. **Monetization parity** — until IAP is submitted with the version and reaches `WAITING_FOR_REVIEW` / `APPROVED`, Leash Pro cannot charge on iOS even if the app goes live.

Play Android is **out of scope** here (already verified correct elsewhere).

## Manual ASC steps (attach IAP to version 1.0 review)

Metadata/pricing is **API-complete** (`READY_TO_SUBMIT`). Remaining work is **UI-only** because the first subscription must ship with an app version and the active submission is locked.

Do these in [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com) (sign in as account with ASC access — Chrome automation hit `authResult=FAILED` 2026-07-09):

1. **Agreements, Tax, and Banking** — Account → confirm **Paid Applications** (and subscriptions) agreements active; tax/banking complete.

2. **Attach IAP to version 1.0** — App → **Distribution** → iOS App → version **1.0** → **In-App Purchases and Subscriptions** → **+** → select **Leash Pro / thumbgate_leash_monthly**.

3. **Submit subscription with version** — If version 1.0 is already `Waiting for Review` and UI blocks edits, Apple requires the **first subscription** on the same submission as the app. Options (UI-only):
   - Add IAP to the in-review version if ASC allows (some accounts can while waiting).
   - Otherwise: **remove version 1.0 from review** → attach IAP → **resubmit app + subscription together** (only if step 2 is blocked).

4. **Re-verify** (agent/local):

   ```bash
   node scripts/verify-asc-listing.js
   ```

   Target: `thumbgate_leash_monthly.state` ∈ `READY_TO_SUBMIT`, `WAITING_FOR_REVIEW`, or `APPROVED`; `leashSubscription.readyToSubmit: true`.

6. **After approval** — release version 1.0 (release type is `AFTER_APPROVAL`). Re-check public lookup:

   ```bash
   curl -sS 'https://itunes.apple.com/lookup?bundleId=com.iganapolsky.hermesmobile'
   ```

## Commands reference

```bash
cd hermes-mobile
node scripts/verify-asc-listing.js
node scripts/ensure-asc-leash-subscription.js
node scripts/submit-asc-for-review.js   # no-op if already WAITING_FOR_REVIEW
```
