## 2026-08-11 — Session GitHub scope still blocked (unchanged since 2026-08-04); LanceDB #3915 pagination fix solved and parked

Same wall documented on 2026-08-04 and re-confirmed by the 2026-08-10 jcode entry: this session's
GitHub access is fixed to `igorganapolsky/mac-yolo-safeguards` only. `add_repo` for
`thinking-machines-lab/tinker`, `lancedb/lancedb`, and `poolsideai/pool` all failed with
"cross-tier adds are not supported in v1"; `list_issues`/`issue_read` against those repos with
explicit `owner`/`repo` were denied with "not configured for this session." One week and (at
least) three runs after this was first flagged, it is still not fixed — this is a session/trigger
configuration problem, not a research gap.

**What still worked (read-only, scope-blind):** `search_issues`/`search_pull_requests` with
`repo:`/`org:` in the query text (not the tool's `owner`/`repo` header) bypass the check, as does
unauthenticated `git clone` and `WebFetch` on public GitHub pages. Used both to survey and to
actually solve one bug.

### Repos surveyed

| Org | Repos | New issues (last 48h) |
|-----|--------|------|
| Thinking Machines Lab | `tinker` | None. Most recent is #51 (2026-07-20, TLS handshake), unchanged since 2026-08-03. |
| Poolside AI | `pool` | None. Same duplicate cluster as prior runs (#25/#32/#33 ACP disconnects, #38 mirrors the already-answered context-length issue). |
| LanceDB | `lancedb` | Several: #3889, #3898, #3914, #3915, #3916, #3917 (2026-08-07 through 2026-08-10). |

### Issue considered and solved

**[lancedb/lancedb#3915](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb/issues/3915)** — `list_tables()`
page-token pagination drops exactly one table at every page boundary (reporter: 15 tables,
`limit: 5` → 13 returned, `t05`/`t11` missing).

Cloned `lancedb/lancedb` (unauthenticated, read-only) and found the root cause in
`ListingDatabase::list_tables` (`rust/lancedb/src/database/listing.rs`): the `page_token`
returned for the next page is the *first table of that page* (inclusive, per
`docs/openapi.yml`: "Specifies the starting position of the next query"), but the next call's
filter excluded it with a strict `>` instead of `>=`. Fix is one character; also added a doc
comment so it isn't "corrected" back, and a regression test that paginates 15 tables with
`limit: 5` and asserts every name comes back exactly once.

**Verified** (Rust toolchain 1.97.0, `cargo test --lib database::listing::tests::` in
`rust/lancedb`, after installing `protobuf-compiler` and the `rustfmt` component in this
sandbox):
- Before fix: new test **FAILS** — `left: [...t04, t06...]` vs `right: [...t04, t05, t06...]`,
  reproducing the exact reported symptom.
- After fix: **31 passed, 0 failed** in the module (every pre-existing `listing.rs` test still
  passes — confirms `table_names()`'s separately-exclusive `start_after` field is untouched).
- `cargo fmt --check` clean on the changed file.

**Parked, not opened** — this session cannot fork or push to `lancedb/lancedb`:
- Patch: `coordination/patches/lancedb-3915-pagination-fix.patch` (git-am-able against main
  `a615306`).
- PR body + posting instructions: `coordination/ready-to-post/lancedb-3915-pagination-fix-pr-body.md`.
- Unlike jcode, LanceDB accepts external PRs normally (see the 2026-08-03 entry, which opened
  #3775 directly) — this only needs a properly-scoped session or Mac-side `gh` to fork, apply the
  patch, and open the PR as drafted.

### Deliberately skipped

| Item | Why |
|------|-----|
| LanceDB #3914 (`table_names()` silent truncation) | Real, but `table_names()` is already deprecated in favor of `list_tables()`; the redesign the reporter asks for (warn-on-truncate or remove the default limit) is an API-design call for maintainers, not a self-contained bug fix |
| LanceDB #3889 (BITMAP validation vs `lance.json`) | Needs a decision on `lance.json` scalar-index semantics from maintainers first (see linked #3890/#3891); not a drop-in fix |
| LanceDB #3868 (tests hang) | No repro in the issue body; can't verify a fix without one |
| LanceDB #3898 (PyPI publish CI failure) | Maintainer-side CI/infra, not fixable from a fork |
| Tinker / Poolside | No new issues in the last 48h; nothing unanswered beyond what 2026-08-03/08-04 already covered |
| ThumbGate mentions | None — no one asked about agent write-gating this run |
| New manufactured question | No real unknown after reading the pagination code |

### Action needed from Igor

Unchanged ask from 2026-08-04, now overdue: whatever creates the session/trigger for this
routine needs to fire into a fresh session with the target org repo as its initial source, or
otherwise grant cross-owner scope — every run since 2026-08-04 has hit the identical wall. Until
then, the routine's actual mandate (open PRs, post comments) can only be **parked** for a
same-owner session to post later, as done here and in the 2026-08-10 jcode run.

## 2026-08-10 — jcode engagement (Igor-directed): #869 fix verified + forensic packet parked; 2 answer drafts

Igor's live directive this run: engage https://github.com/1jehuang/jcode (16.8k★ Rust agent
harness) — "open PRs, solve issues, answer questions, promote us." Also: the 2026-08-06 entry
(LanceDB #3759 fix) never merged — its PR #1513 was closed per backlog policy; that fix remains
live at `igorganapolsky/lancedb@fix/blob-coerce-null-column`. The relay session
(`cse_01SJca4WbW1AtQZmPP8uSQnx`) that held its upstream-PR step was garbage-collected
unapproved — the parked fork branch is now the sole artifact; do not rebuild relay machinery
for it (anti-babysitting: a relay whose only output is an unseen approval prompt is not a park).

### Key structural finding

**jcode does not accept external PRs at all** — PR creation is collaborator-restricted
(confirmed firsthand by #870's reporter, who had a finished fix branch and could not open a PR);
CONTRIBUTING.md says external patches are reference material the maintainer rewrites, and an
automated triage pipeline sweeps issue bands within days. The accepted contribution format is a
**forensic issue comment**: confirmed root cause + minimal patch + regression tests + evidence.
That's what was produced.

### What was produced (all verified locally on jcode master `5ae2385`)

1. **#869 (Codex quota widget shows two weekly bars when hourly window absent) — solved.**
   Root cause: `classify_openai_limits` (`crates/jcode-base/src/usage/openai_helpers.rs:80`)
   classifies a weekly-only limit into `seven_day` AND lets the blind `five_hour` fallback
   (`generic_non_spark.first()`) re-adopt the same window; the existing dedupe only guards the
   other direction. Fix: symmetric dedupe in the `five_hour` fallback. Two regression tests
   added. **Before fix:** `test_classify_openai_limits_weekly_only_does_not_duplicate_into_hourly`
   FAILS (reproduces the double bar), 3 others pass. **After fix:** full
   `cargo test -p jcode-base usage::` = **44 passed, 0 failed**.
   Parked: `coordination/patches/jcode-869-weekly-only-dedupe.patch` (git-am-able) +
   `coordination/ready-to-post/jcode-869-forensic-issue-comment.md`.
2. **#866 (how to migrate memory from `~/.jcode` to project `.jcode`) — answered from code.**
   `jcode_dir()` (`crates/jcode-storage/src/lib.rs:150`) honors `$JCODE_HOME`; project memory is
   already per-project but centrally stored under `memory/projects/<DefaultHasher(path)>.json`
   (`crates/jcode-base/src/memory.rs:252`), with a hash-stability caveat worth flagging.
   Parked: `coordination/ready-to-post/jcode-866-memory-migration-answer.md`.
3. **#803 (`jcode run` has no turn/step limit — runaway gap) — the one genuine ThumbGate
   opening.** The issue is literally about runaway-agent limits, this repo's core domain. Drafted
   a value-first comment (three-guard pattern: max-turns + per-turn timeout + no-progress
   detector, exit semantics) with the single permitted ThumbGate/mac-yolo-safeguards mention.
   Parked: `coordination/ready-to-post/jcode-803-max-turns-thumbgate-comment.md`.

### Why parked instead of posted

Cross-owner GitHub API writes (issues/comments/forks on `1jehuang/jcode`) are scope-blocked in
this session type (`fork_repository` denied; same wall as 2026-08-04/08-06 entries). The
ready-to-post files carry posting instructions + freshness checks; the Mac-side fleet (`gh`
authenticated) or any properly-scoped session can post them verbatim. Per the new
anti-babysitting protocol (`skills/anti-babysitting/SKILL.md`), this is a park, not an ask.

### Deliberately skipped

| Item | Why |
|------|-----|
| jcode PR | Structurally impossible — collaborator-only PR creation |
| #874, #873 | Real bugs, but triage-bot sweep imminent and root causes already stated in the issues; #869 chosen as the deepest verifiable value-add |
| #870 | Reporter already has a complete fix branch awaiting the maintainer |
| #861, #830, #834 | Duplicate / already fixed-pending-release |
| Blanket promo | Spam-guard rules stand; one genuine mention drafted (#803), zero elsewhere |

## 2026-08-03 (PM) — Tinker regression tests + LanceDB naive datetime fix

### Repos surveyed

| Org | Repos |
|-----|--------|
| Thinking Machines Lab | `thinking-machines-lab/tinker`, `tinker-cookbook`, `tinker-feedback`, `batch_invariant_ops`, `tinker-project-ideas` |
| Poolside AI | `poolsideai/pool`, `bridge-sdk`, `pooleval`, `reference_architectures`, `n8n-poolside-node` |
| LanceDB | `lancedb/lancedb`, `lancedb/lance` (via issue search; format repo is `lance-format/lance`), `docs`, `vectordb-recipes` |

### Issues considered

**Tinker / TML**
- [#51](https://github.com/thinking-machines-lab/tinker/issues/51) — pyqwest 0.7.0 TLS `UnknownIssuer` (runtime fix already on main/`0.24.0`; missing regression tests) → **acted**
- [#139](https://github.com/thinking-machines-lab/tinker-feedback/issues/139) — `get_tokenizer()` needs private `tml_tokenizers` (not fixable without internal package)
- [#44](https://github.com/thinking-machines-lab/tinker/issues/44) checkpoint probe — feature work, large surface
- `batch_invariant_ops` #23 TF32 precision — needs GPU kernel expertise this run

**Poolside**
- `poolsideai/pool` is **not open source** (README/CHANGELOG/LICENSE only; agent is closed binary). No code PR possible.
- [#36](https://github.com/poolsideai/pool/issues/36) context length — maintainer already documented `POOLSIDE_STANDALONE_CONTEXT_LENGTH`
- ACP disconnect cluster (#22, #25, #32, #33) — need user logs; maintainers already triaging
- Docs-only provider requests (#16, #29) — README-only / vendor-promotional; skipped per no typo/README-only PR rule

**LanceDB**
- [#3765](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb/issues/3765) / [#3766](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb/issues/3766) / [#3767](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb/issues/3767) — already have PRs from `@Adityaj0` → **skipped** (don't pile-on)
- [#3262](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb/issues/3262) good-first-issue: datetime timezone `lit()` integration — **acted** (found real naive/local-offset bug while writing tests)
- [#3211](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb/issues/3211) camelCase `col()` — already partially covered in `TestColNaming*`

#### Tinker PR #54 detail

- **Change:** unit tests only for `_default_pyqwest_transport()` locking `tls_include_system_certs=True` + TypeError fallback.
- **Verified:** `python -m pytest tests/test_pyqwest_transport_tls.py -v` → **2 passed** (Python 3.12, editable install of main + tests).

#### LanceDB PR #3775 detail

- **Bug:** naive `lit(datetime)` used `.timestamp()` (local) while Arrow stores naive as UTC wall clock → equality filters returned 0 rows on non-UTC hosts (reproduced on US Eastern with `lancedb==0.36.0`).
- **Fix:** naive → `replace(tzinfo=timezone.utc).timestamp()`; aware unchanged.
- **Tests:** `TestExprDatetimeTimezoneIntegration` (6 cases from #3262 matrix).
- **Verified:** `maturin develop` then `pytest python/python/tests/test_expr.py -v` → **102 passed**.

### What was answered

- Tinker #51: confirmed fix shipped in 0.24.0 + linked regression PR.
- LanceDB #3262: concrete repro + root cause + linked fix PR. No ThumbGate mention.

## 2026-08-04 — BLOCKED: session GitHub scope prevented any external action

### Repos surveyed

| Org | Repos |
|-----|--------|
| Thinking Machines Lab | `thinking-machines-lab/tinker`, `tinker-cookbook`, `tinker-feedback` |
| Poolside AI | `poolsideai/pool` (org-wide issue search) |
| LanceDB | `lancedb/lancedb`, `lance-format/lance` |

### What happened

This run's session was created with `igorganapolsky/mac-yolo-safeguards` as its only initial source. `add_repo` refuses any repo owned by someone other than `igorganapolsky` once a session already has a same-owner repo attached ("cross-tier adds are not supported in v1"), so only two forks could be attached: `igorganapolsky/tinker` and `igorganapolsky/lancedb`.

Critically, **every `mcp__github__*` tool that takes structured `owner`/`repo` parameters — read or write — is denied for any repo outside that attached set**, including read-only calls (`issue_read`, `pull_request_read`, `get_file_contents`, `list_pull_requests`) and, by the same access-control layer, the write calls this routine depends on (`add_issue_comment`, `create_pull_request`, `fork_repository`). Verified concretely: `list_pull_requests(owner: thinking-machines-lab, repo: tinker)` and `get_file_contents(owner: lancedb, repo: lancedb)` both returned "Access denied ... not configured for this session," identical in form to the errors from write-shaped calls. I did not attempt an actual `create_pull_request`/`add_issue_comment` against an out-of-scope repo to "test" this, since a failed write attempt is not a safe probe and the read-side denials already establish the pattern unambiguously.

Practically, this run could: search issues org-wide (`search_issues`/`search_pull_requests` don't take owner/repo as headers, so they slipped through), and read public pages via `WebFetch` and plain `git clone`/`ls-remote` (unauthenticated, so scope-blind). It could **not** comment on an issue or open a PR against `thinking-machines-lab/*`, `poolsideai/*`, `lancedb/lancedb`, or `lance-format/lance` — the exact actions this routine exists to perform.

### Issues considered (research only — could not act)

**Tinker** — no issues opened in `tinker`/`tinker-cookbook` in the last 48h. `tinker-feedback` [#139](https://github.com/thinking-machines-lab/tinker-feedback/issues/139) (`get_tokenizer()` fails, imports private `tml_tokenizers`) is unchanged from 2026-08-03: not externally fixable.

**Poolside** — no issues opened across `poolsideai/*` in the last 48h. Nothing new to reconsider from the 2026-08-03 skip list.

**LanceDB** — [#3764](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb/issues/3764): real, reproducible, unclaimed bug — `lancedb` fails to build on arm64 (`cannot find aarch64 in scope` in `lance-core`'s `cpu.rs:172`). Root cause lives in `lance-format/lance` (pinned via git tag in `lancedb`'s `Cargo.toml`), which this session cannot fork or push to, so no PR was possible even though the fix looks tractable (gate the aarch64 NEON-detection path behind the right `cfg`). [#3773](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb/issues/3773) (debugger hangs inspecting `LanceDBConnection` on Python 3.13.5) is real but needs PyO3/debugpy-internals investigation deeper than one sitting. [#3765](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb/issues/3765)–[#3767](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb/issues/3767) remain claimed by `@Adityaj0`. `lance-format/lance` had ~20 issues filed in the prior 24h with detailed repros (e.g. [#8217](https://github.com/lance-format/lance/issues/8217), dictionary-encoding null corruption) — spot-checking #8217 found it already has an open fix PR (#8220) within hours of filing, consistent with an internal team sweep triaging its own fuzzing output faster than an external contributor could realistically land something first; moot anyway since the repo is out of session scope.

### What was opened

Nothing against any of the three target orgs — blocked as above.

### Deliberately skipped

| Item | Why |
|------|-----|
| LanceDB #3764 (arm64 build fix) | Fix belongs in `lance-format/lance`; session cannot fork/push there |
| Tinker feedback #139 | Same as 2026-08-03 — requires unpublished `tml_tokenizers` |
| Poolside | No new issues, and repo is still closed-source per 2026-08-03 finding (not re-verified this run since no PR/comment was possible regardless) |
| Comments on any issue | `add_issue_comment` requires the same owner/repo scope that blocked PR creation |

### ThumbGate mentions

**None** this run.

### Action needed from Igor

This is an environment/session configuration problem, not a "nothing worth doing" day — a real, unclaimed bug was found (LanceDB #3764) and could not be submitted. Whatever creates the session/trigger for this routine needs to either (a) fire into a fresh session per run with the target org repo as its initial source instead of `mac-yolo-safeguards`, or (b) otherwise grant this session cross-owner repo scope. Until that's fixed, every future run of this routine will hit the same wall.
